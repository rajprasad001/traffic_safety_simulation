# Traffic-Safety-Simulation
Road Traffic Safety is a major concern in Germany. The data from every major and minor accidents are recorded and are analyzed for the purpose of reducing the mishaps. This results in enhanced safety of the public and also reduction in monitory loss.

Our task was to analyze a Traffic node in the city of Magdeburg and suggest valid safety measures that could help to enhance the safety of the node and also if possible increase the throughput.

For the successful completion of the task, the project was subdivided in to several milestones:-

**1. Study of Node**

   Analyzing the node and the data provided by the city office is a  crucial task as it helps us to pave the pathway for future    milestones.

   The intersection comprised various elements that made the node complicated and also prone to accidents. The node comprises a tram stop which itself is a junction as the tram moves into two different directions. The node has a Supermarket and Gas station adjacent to it. There is a huge traffic during the peak hours which sometimes lead to caotic situation in the middle of the node and needs extreme caution from the drivers to prevent any accident.

**2. Planning and formulate a conceptual model of the node**

   Planning is a crucial task as it helps the team to stay on the track and at the same time monitor the progress.

   Conceptual model is the base of the model. It incorporates every detail that is important for the modeling and experiments.
A concpetual model helps to identify the parameters for which data is to be recorded. 
The conceptual model was further drawn using Petri Nets.

**3. Data Collection**

   As per Conceptual model, the data was recorded and the distributions of the data was analyzed. This data was further used as an input for the model.

**4. Building the Model**
    Based on the conceptual model and the data collected, a software prototype of the actual intersection was modelled using Anylogic. 

**5. validating the Model**
    It is crucial to validate and verify the model build. This is to make sure that the model represents the actual node with some confidence. The outputs from the model was compared with output of the actual intersection and on the basis of some parameters like throughput, the model was validated.

**6. performing Experiments**
    The validated model was used for experiments in order to suggest the possible solutions to the city office.
    Some of the few experiments performed were:-
    
    a. Incorporating speed limit
    b. Adding extra lanes
    c. Changing the traffic signal cycles
    
   Results from all experiments were recorded and compared.
    
**7. Suggesting best Results**
    All the experiments somehow will enhance the safety of the intersection. But safety in itself cannot be measured. Therefore, it was checked that the experiments performed, do not create a chaos in the node as seen in real world scenario. Also, it was made sure that the suggestions provided are not adversly affecting the throughput of the node.
